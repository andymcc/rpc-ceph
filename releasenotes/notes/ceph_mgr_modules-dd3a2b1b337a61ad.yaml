features:
  - Add ``playbooks/add-mgr-modules.yml`` optional playbook
    to configure and enable Ceph mgr modules. This is a temporary
    playbook backported from ceph-ansible v3.1, and will be
    removed once ceph-ansible v3.1.0 is released and rpc-ceph
    moves to consume it.
    Specify the modules to utilise with the ``ceph_mgr_modules``
    variable, which by default contains ``restful``, ``status``,
    ``balancer``, and ``dashboard``.
